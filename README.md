# Animal Soundboard

Animal Soundboard is a keyboard-like toy for playing unique animal-themed sounds. Just press a letter key on your keyboard, or click/tap on the tiles, to play an interesting and lovely sound.

The sounds and site were created by Chris Schnaars. The illustrations were sourced on Shutterstock, and done by the user named [avian](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/avian).
